        "description": "I'm a software developer from Venezuela who loves to travel and take photos. So I decided to build something that mixes all of that: a personal project where I can show the places I've visited, use my frontend skills, and share a bit of my journey along the way. \n\nMost of the photos you'll find here were taken by me, or at least, they show what I saw. I wasn't really into photography during my first few trips, but after getting my first camera, I slowly started paying more attention to how I capture things. I'm still learning, just enjoying it as a hobby, but as you go through each slide, you might notice how both the places and the way I see them have evolved."

We had originally planned to go a year later, but we realized this was the perfect moment to make one of our biggest dreams come true: visiting the pyramids. Along with Japan, Egypt had always been one of my most desired destinations since childhood, full of history and mystery.",

Outside the airport, taxi drivers fought to take us to the terminal. From the bus, we saw the tip of a pyramid rising above the city, it felt like we were kids again. At the hotel, after some setbacks, I climbed to the rooftop and saw them with my own eyes. Later, we took a camel tour, went inside one of the pyramids, and I ended the day with a post dedicated to my mom: 'I did it.' She always told me I'd visit Egypt one day. And I did."

We arrived in the afternoon, but getting transport wasn't easy. The Careem app wasn't working, drivers kept canceling, and we were left alone outside the airport. One taxi driver mocked us for using the app, but then came Eddy, kind, respectful, and even spoke a bit of Spanish. From the start, he gave us a good feeling and offered to take us where we needed.",
        "description_second": "Eddy suggested that instead of going straight to the hotel, we should head to Karnak Temple while we still had time. We trusted him, and it was the right call. I had always imagined walking between those massive columns you see on Instagram… and there I was. Unlike the chaos of the pyramids, Karnak was peaceful, almost empty by then. The carved walls and towering columns left me even more amazed than Giza. Thanks to Eddy, we didn't waste the afternoon and got to experience one of the most impressive places in Egypt the moment we arrived."

No wonder Egyptologists dedicate their lives to studying these markings, they hold the keys to how people lived, what they believed, and what they left behind.

But like all family trips, things got complicated: we found out my nephew couldn't enter the UAE without one of his parents. What followed was a race against time. We had to get my sister's passport urgently, rearrange flights… but in the end, we made it. We were all together again.\n\nWe met in Madrid, a city I already knew and one I was sure they would love. It was December, and there was no better way to start the holidays than walking through El Retiro Park. With hugs, laughter, and relief, it truly felt like a retreat, no worries, just enjoying the moment and being together again."

The game was against Monza, in December 2023, and we won 3-0 with goals from Reijnders, Jan Carlo Simic, and Okafor.\n\nOriginally, the plan after Paris was to take a bus to Zurich and then the Bernina train to Milan with my family. But when I saw the match date, I made a call: I'd go ahead on my own. From Strasbourg, I had to race to catch the train to Paris and then fly to Milan. It was my first time traveling completely solo, and the adrenaline was intense, I couldn't find a taxi, the streets were packed, and yes… I even jumped on the tram without a ticket, desperate to make it in time.\n\nBut it was all worth it. I explored Milan a bit in the morning, had breakfast, and headed to the stadium. As I was walking up the stairs, the song “Che confusione” started playing. I ran until I got that full view of the pitch, the one in this photo, and it was just incredible. Singing with the curva, watching the team win… one of the best moments of my life."

It was our second time visiting, and since flights from Abu Dhabi were cheap, we took the chance to stay for one night and relive some of its magic. And what better way to do that than by returning to the Colosseum? We didn't go inside this time, we had done that on our previous trip, but just seeing it from the outside is still incredible. It has something that connects you with history, with the gladiators, with what once was.\n\nThe plan was to end the day with a romantic dinner facing the Colosseum. My wife had made a reservation at a restaurant that supposedly had that view. But when they called to confirm if we were going, we opened Google Maps… and something didn't add up. How could it be a 40-minute bus ride to a place with a view of the Colosseum if the Colosseum was right there?\n\nAfter checking online about the restaurant, we found out the famous “view of the Colosseum” was actually just a photo of it on the wall. A poster. Yes, the restaurant had an image of the Colosseum, not the real thing. So we called back and canceled. It wasn't the night we planned, but it was still one to remember."

In Zagreb, that mix feels natural. Everything moves calmly, and you find yourself walking without a plan, stopping to take a photo, trying a snack, or just watching the city go by.\n\nBetween how cozy it feels and how well-kept everything is, Zagreb is a city I'd definitely recommend, especially around Christmas.\n\nFunny thing about this trip: Zagreb ended up being one of our favorite experiences.

Lots of stairs.\n\nI took this photo from the top of one of those narrow stairway alleys, just before starting the descent. Right in front of me, a metal railing divided the path, and what caught my eye was a sticker that read: “Muy Bien.” In Spanish. It felt like a little motivational message, like, \"Well done, now time to head down.\"\n\nLisbon is a city made for walking, up and down, but it's those small, quirky moments that make the experience memorable."

I figured if she wants to return every year, why not come for New Year's? That way, we'd be in Spain on both December 31st, 2024 and January 1st, 2025. Two years in one trip, shark mindset.\n\nWe stayed near Gran Vía to make the most of our time, and the photo I took of the Metrópolis building under that clear blue sky sums up how pretty Madrid can be, even in winter. The night of the 31st was packed though, so many people that we couldn't really see the fireworks at Puerta del Sol… but in the end, being there to kick off the new year in a city we love made it all worth it."

About 15 minutes later, the same girl stopped us and said she had taken our photo, thought we looked like a sweet couple, and asked if we wanted it. Just… wow.\n\nThis final image is of the reddish sky at sunset, as if the city itself was saying goodbye. One of my favorite cities in the world, no doubt."

It's a city with a strong identity, full of style, and very aesthetic. It feels like everything fits, like the city moves at your pace. It's a relatively small island, but everything is so concentrated that it becomes this urban jungle.\n\nYou can feel the city's personality in the small details: they use bamboo scaffolding for construction, something truly unique. The Cantonese food, which we already love in Venezuela, tastes even better there. In the center, you'll see British-style trams, a reminder that Hong Kong was once a British colony. And of course, the iconic neon signs give the city its signature glow.\n\nOne of the most famous experiences is the light show you can watch from Kowloon facing Hong Kong Island (yes, Hong Kong is divided into several main regions). I went one night to see it… and honestly, it left me a bit disappointed. But in the middle of all that, I managed to capture this photo.

Makes sense, though you still feel it.\n\nSoHo has a very different vibe from the rest of the city. It feels more western, filled with international food spots, cafés, bars, and lots of art. The steep streets, wall murals, creative storefronts, and the way everything is laid out creates visuals like the one in this photo: angled, layered, and really photogenic.\n\nIt's one of those areas that make you want to keep walking, snapping photos, and stumbling into a new place to eat without even planning it."

I grew up in Unare, in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, in block 26. And when I saw these buildings, my first thought was: “So what's all the fuss about these buildings?” Sure, they're much taller, but to me, they felt like home. I identified with that place, saving the differences, of course.\n\nWhat really struck me was how this became a tourist spot. Just imagining people taking photos in the blocks of Unare made me laugh. But hey… people always see with different eyes what you grew up with.\n\nThis area is clearly more humble compared to places like the city center or Nathan Road. And that was good, because I got to see another side of Hong Kong. Even the metro ride showed it: we came from commercial zones, and on this line, we were the only tourists.

They say it's the largest hand-made wooden structure in the world (and yeah, I had to Google that part).\n\nThe place is super cool. From the garden, you can see the mountains in the background or skyscrapers peeking through the greenery. It's surrounded by the community and feels very naturally integrated.\n\nI'll always think of spaces like this as the lungs of a city. This complex doesn't just have pagodas and gardens, there's also a water mill, a koi pond, and lots of thoughtful little details that make it special."

But it wasn't until after several other trips that we finally decided to go. Well… it was more my wife's idea, but I didn't exactly resist.\n\nWhen most people picture Bali, this is probably what comes to mind: lush green hills with perfectly layered rice terraces. And yes, that image is real, Tegallalang in Ubud is where many of those iconic postcards come from.\n\nChoosing where to stay in Bali isn't simple. There are plenty of areas like Ubud, Seminyak, Uluwatu, and each offers something different. We chose Ubud, close to places like Monkey Forest, Tirta Empul, Goa Gajah, and Penglipuran. But 'close' is relative. In Bali, even a short distance can feel long thanks to the traffic. And if you can't ride a scooter (like me, I tried and failed spectacularly), getting around becomes a challenge. That means sitting in a car, stuck in narrow roads, wondering if there's a better way.\n\nAs for the rice terraces themselves: they're beautiful, and you can walk around them and take in the view. But everything around feels built for photos. Swings, rentable dresses, cafés with views, pools facing the fields… it's all visually stunning, but curated for tourists. It feels like Bali has leaned more into catering to Instagram than sharing its true identity. Instead of saying, “This is Bali, enjoy who we are,” it feels more like, “Here's the best backdrop for your photo.” Is it still worth it? Definitely. Don't forget to look beyond the lens from time to time."

Our guide took us straight to the section where the ritual happens. It's like a large pool, and the water flows from a row of stone fountains. You move from one to the next, letting the water pour over your head, closing your eyes, breathing, and moving on.\n\nNow, I'm not usually into this type of thing. And when they told me I had to wear a green wrap that smelled musty, like it hadn't been properly washed, and change in a shared room with wet, slippery floors... I had my doubts. But hey, we were there. Might as well do it.\n\nOnce I got into the water and started going through each station, everything shifted. The sound of the water, the temperature, the atmosphere, I completely relaxed. You don't think about anything. You're just there. And by the end, I was really glad I did it. Weird, for sure.

And I wasn't the only one.\n\nWhat I didn't know at the time is that the waters between Bali and Nusa Penida are known for having strong currents and big waves. It's not uncommon for ferries to struggle with the rough seas, now I understand why.\n\nWhen we arrived on the island, I had to recover with some candy and soda we picked up at a small shop. Between each stop of the tour, I was lying down in the back seat, trying to rest until the next viewpoint. But nothing compared to the return trip. I was already sick, and the ride back was twice as rough. I threw up a lot, barely made it to the car in Bali, and passed out until we got to the villa.

Everything is already beautiful, but the cherry blossoms change everything. That soft pink color gives the cities a magical feeling you can't really compare to anything else.\n\nThe tricky part is that even though there's a set season, the peak bloom varies by region and year. It's not easy to time it perfectly. But luckily, without even planning it, we arrived when the sakura were at their best across all of Japan.\n\nOne of the places where we felt it most was Sakuragaoka Sakura Matsuri, a street in Shibuya that turns into a visual show. The road is lined with cherry blossoms and classic Japanese lanterns, and it gets so crowded that guards are posted to keep people from blocking traffic while trying to take photos. If you want a better view, the best thing to do is go up to a higher spot near the station, where you can see the whole stretch from above."

Stores, lights, massive screens, maid cafés, restaurants, and things you didn't even know existed. It's like all of Tokyo packed into one district.\n\nBut the real magic happens at night. Once the sun goes down, Shinjuku transforms. Neon lights take over, and the whole vibe shifts. Young people fill the streets, and you'll often be approached by promoters inviting you to bars or clubs (Beware of this). Some encounters might feel confusing at first, not because they're shady, but because nightlife in Tokyo, especially here, plays by different rules. In Japan, there's a whole industry around companionship and entertainment that's more about atmosphere and persona than anything else. It's a cultural nuance that's hard to grasp until you see it.\n\nIt can be overwhelming depending on the time and where you wander, but there's something about that energy that pulls you in. It's not something you can explain. You just have to be there to get it.\n\nLike the meme says: “You wouldn't get the f*cking vibe.”"

Nature in the middle of the concrete.\n\nThere are several garden areas, many in the Japanese style (although... we're in Japan, so technically they're all Japanese gardens, right?). The contrast between nature and the city in the background makes walking through it feel special.\n\nBefore going in, we stopped for our favorite breakfast in Japan: the Ham & Maribo Cheese sandwich from Starbucks. Eating it there, in such a peaceful park, was the perfect way to start the day.\n\nThe park is big, so there's plenty to walk and explore. Shinjuku really has everything, and this park is more proof of that."

And this one is definitely part of that list.\n\nIf you've never been to Kyoto and only seen photos of the forest, you might think it's huge. And while the whole forest is big, the actual path surrounded by tall bamboo, the part that shows up in most pictures, is more limited. Still, it's worth visiting.\n\nTaking a photo here without people is tough, like in most touristy spots in Kyoto. Some people suggest visiting quieter bamboo forests, and if I ever get to visit a third time, I'd love to try that. But I still think Arashiyama is a must.\n\nNear the start of the trail, there's a small temple where you can write a wish on a wooden plaque and hang it up. Both times we visited, we made a wish, and both came true.\n\nFor me, the forest itself wasn't the most impressive part.

Wooden facades, tiled irimoya-style rooftops, bamboo-slatted windows... everything feels like it belongs to another era. Even if you don't know the terms, you recognize the feeling: it's that classic Japan we've all seen in old prints or movies.\n\nThe best part is that you don't need to visit a specific landmark to see it. Just walk around and you'll find it anywhere. And if you're lucky enough to go during cherry blossom season, like I did, the combination of sakura and old wooden buildings is just magic.\n\nThat mix of architecture and atmosphere is one of the reasons why Kyoto never disappoints.

Unlike other temples where you have to walk through gardens or long paths to find something eye-catching, here it hits you from the start, you arrive and immediately look up at this huge structure.\n\nAnd if you think that's it... here comes the tough part: a super long staircase that leads up to the main temple complex. But it's not just long, the steps are tall! I have some knee problems, so it was a bit of a struggle for me. To make things worse (or funnier), a group of elderly Japanese people, probably in their 80s, were climbing at the same pace as me. I just kept thinking, “I have to make it up before them.”\n\nAt the top, the main temple is wide and beautiful, but my favorite part was the garden. There's a small pond, a little bridge, and a smaller structure that looks like it came out of a storybook. That was the spot I liked the most, and it's the photo I decided to share here."

It's the kind of view you expect from Kyoto, wooden houses, stone paths, plants by the door... there's even a home here with a tiny pond right outside the entrance.\n\nIt's beautiful, but also a real neighborhood. People live here. And with the rise of tourism in Japan, especially in Kyoto, it makes sense that some locals feel uncomfortable. Some homes have signs asking not to take photos, and I get it, the streets are narrow, and what used to be quiet is now crowded all the time.\n\nStill, the architecture and atmosphere make this area really special. You're also not far from Gion (the geisha district), so everything around here invites you to slow down and explore. The best part? You can just wander.

It's a peaceful, stunning scene that stays with you.\n\nThis view is well-known, and for good reason. The river is nestled between mountains, and the contrast between the green and the water makes it incredibly photogenic. It's easily one of my favorite landscapes in the country.\n\nBut if it's beautiful from above, it's even better from below. To get there, you walk down a long path with uneven stone steps, surrounded by trees. You have to be careful, it's steep and there are no handrails. As you go deeper, the sounds of the city fade, and everything becomes quiet, almost like you're wandering into a forest where you could get lost. Until suddenly, the river appears right in front of you.\n\nI haven't done the boat ride yet, but I'd love to someday.

What makes it stand out isn't just that it's gold and shiny, but the fact that it's built next to a lake. Its reflection on the water makes it feel even more special. It almost looks like it's floating, like a small garden suspended in the landscape. I really enjoyed been there.\n\nUnlike other popular spots in Kyoto, I didn't notice many shops or food stalls nearby, which made the area feel quieter.

On the streets: tuk-tuks darting through traffic, temples on every corner. Religion here isn't hidden, it's part of daily life.\n\nOne of the most unexpected moments on our first day was when a man stopped us in the street and asked where we wanted to go. We were suspicious at first, but he ended up helping us plan a route to three interesting spots. He stopped a tuk-tuk, gave the driver instructions… and off we went.\n\nOur first stop was a classic Buddhist temple, with a red roof, golden edges, and an atmosphere of deep peace. A beautiful way to begin our time in Bangkok."

          "description": "One of the most iconic stops in Bangkok is Wat Pho, a Buddhist temple complex that houses the famous reclining Buddha statue, covered in gold leaf. It's so massive, it can't even fit into a single photo.\n\nThe temple itself is not very big, but it's full of charm: traditional structures, koi ponds, and peaceful little corners.\n\nRight next to it runs a river, and a short ferry ride across takes you to another spectacular temple: Wat Arun, which we explore in the next slide."

          "description": "Wat Arun is one of Thailand's most famous temples, and its main feature, the central prang, is covered in tiny pieces of colorful porcelain.\n\nYou don't just admire it from a distance. You can climb up through steep staircases and narrow walkways, getting close to the intricate tile work.\n\nOne thing I noticed about Thailand is how they still build and restore their temples the traditional way. It's a country that respects its roots.\n\nBangkok isn't just about parties and nightlife, though it has that too. Traveling is also about seeing cultural landmarks. This was one of our first big trips, and even though I wasn't focused on photography back then, I managed to capture some angles that make me want to return... just to shoot it all again properly."

          "description": "Wat Saket, also known as the Golden Mountain, sits atop a hill in the middle of Bangkok. You have to climb a lot of stairs to reach it, but the view is totally worth it.\n\nThat day, we couldn't go inside because my wife was wearing shorts, and at Buddhist temples, modest clothing is required. It's an important detail to remember when visiting religious sites.\n\nStill, being up there and seeing the temple from the outside gave us a sense of its energy. Sometimes you don't need to go in to appreciate a place, just being there and showing respect is enough to feel the moment."

          "description": "One of the most unique experiences near Bangkok is visiting the floating market, even though it's not really in Bangkok, but much farther out. We booked a taxi through Bolt, and while our Thai friends said we paid too much, as tourists it still felt pretty affordable.\n\nOnce there, the boat ride itself has a cost. Depending on the route, you might pay per person or for the whole boat. It's not cheap, but honestly, the experience is worth it.\n\nAs you cruise along the canals, you pass floating shops selling all kinds of souvenirs: crafts, clothes, paintings, local dishes, and even small boats offering ice cream right from the water.\n\nWe fell in love with a painting of Bangkok showing a tuk-tuk in the rain. It cost $100, which is definitely not cheap, but some of the artwork on display was amazing. This one felt too beautiful to leave behind.\n\nThe photo shows one of those eye-catching shops, packed with colorful things: from decorative signs to action figures of famous movie characters. Yes, it's touristy, but it has its charm."

          "description": "One of the things that surprised me most about the floating market wasn't just the shops, but seeing how many homes are literally built over the water.\n\nAs you ride along the canals, you pass by everyday life: plants, hammocks, laundry hanging, all in a peaceful, green setting. Sometimes, if you do the full tour, they'll take you to a small hidden temple nestled among the trees.\n\nBut the most unexpected part... the monitor lizards. They move through the water like they belong there. Most are small, but a few can get really big. I just hope you don't come across one of the huge ones, though watching them from a safe distance gives the place a wild, memorable twist."

This is one of the largest Chinatowns in the world, and you feel it immediately.\n\nYou'll find everything: humble street stalls, Michelin-starred restaurants, incredible food, crowds, lights, and nonstop energy. Honestly, it's one of my favorite places I've visited on any trip.\n\nI didn't get to eat at the Michelin spot, but I had some amazing noodles and tried these Nutella-filled buns that a Thai friend had recommended. Unforgettable! I later told another friend to go try them, she did, and confirmed: absolutely delicious.\n\nThe atmosphere is chaotic but vibrant. Streets packed with people, food everywhere, intense smells, red and gold lights... and yes, even fried insects and scorpions for the bold. Most of the action happens along the main avenue, which feels like a city within Bangkok itself.\n\nIf you're looking for something different and full of character, this is a must-visit."

          "description": "Our plan in Thailand was to start with the beaches down south, so we flew to Phuket to do some island tours before heading back to Bangkok. The first tour was one of the most exciting: a visit to Pileh Lagoon, Maya Bay, and Phi Phi Island, with snorkeling included.\n\nThe place I was most excited to see was Pileh Lagoon, and it didn't disappoint. The water was a stunning turquoise green, full of large, colorful parrotfish swimming around us. We paid a little extra to take a smaller boat deeper into the lagoon, and it was absolutely worth it.\n\nAfter snorkeling in crystal-clear water, we reached Maya Bay, where The Beach with Leonardo DiCaprio was filmed. Swimming is not allowed to protect the ecosystem, but we still saw a baby shark near the shore. A perfect moment.\n\nWe ended the tour at Phi Phi Island, where we had a buffet lunch and walked around a bit. While some people stay overnight, we did just a full day tour and returned to Phuket in the afternoon. A full, beautiful experience!"

          "description": "Another full-day tour we did from Phuket was to the famous James Bond Island, known for its iconic eroded rock rising from the sea, a filming location for The Man with the Golden Gun.\n\nThe tour included a fascinating surprise: kayaking through a massive rock formation, where we had to lie down in the kayak to squeeze through a narrow gap and see the ceiling inside. Very unique experience.\n\nThis area of Phuket is different, the water is murkier, so there's no snorkeling, but the scenery is still amazing. As with all these tours, a delicious buffet lunch was included, this time served in a floating fishing village. The locals sell handmade crafts, and you can find great souvenirs at good prices.\n\nSeeing how people live literally on the water left a mark on me. Thailand has many sides, and this one was completely different, but just as special."

We had seen it on the map since the beginning of our trip, and although we left it for the end, the visit was totally worth it.\n\nGetting there requires quite a climb, but once you're up, it's clear why the spot is so iconic. It was the first giant Buddha statue we had seen in person, and while I didn't manage to take a great photo, the visual impact was powerful.\n\nFrom the top, you get a beautiful view of the coastline, the beach, the sea, and all of Phuket stretching out below in soft greens and blues. Despite the size and the number of visitors, it's a very peaceful place."

Surrounding it are other sculptures, prayer rooms, and areas where you can take part in local traditions.\n\nOne of these is leaving a wish or dedication by purchasing a gold-colored metal leaf, a donation that helps support the temple's construction. That's what we chose to do: leave a small contribution with a message for our loved ones.\n\nIt's a simple but meaningful gesture. Walking among the altars, seeing people praying or writing calmly on their leaves, makes you feel part of something spiritual, even if you're just passing through.\n\nIt was a lovely way to end the visit, with something more personal than just viewing the statue from afar."
